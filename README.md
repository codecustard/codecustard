## About Me

Video games jumpstarted my passion for programming. I dreamed about creating my own [MMORPG](http://kingdomisland.com). So I scavenged the web, before the golden age of Youtube, gathering all the knowledge I needed. I came across a program called Game Maker and took a stab at making small video games. Eventually, I realized that I would need to learn how the internet worked to create an MMORPG. I was lucky enough to take the Cisco Academy course while in high school and got CCNA and A+ certified. I also learned about **C++**, **databases**, and **MySQL**. With the knowledge that I obtained, I helped develop a social game for kids called Kingdom Island.

Currently, I enjoy working with web related tech stacks as I find them extremely versatile. Web-based services, desktop applications, mobile applications, smart-devices, they're extremely universal. What sort of project are you working on? Shoot me a message. I'd be interested to know more.

### TLDR - [Nerd that codes](https://codecustard.io).
